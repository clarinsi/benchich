# BENCHiÄ‡ -  the benchmark for Bosnian, Croatian, Montenegrin, Serbian (and friends)

For now we cover two tasks:

- [NER](ner/) - Named entity recognition benchmark for Croatian and Serbian
- [SENT](sent/) - Sentiment identification in parliamentary proceedings in the Croatian, Bosnian, Serbian parliament
- [COPA](copa/) - Choice Of Plausible Alternatives on Slovenian, Croatian, Serbian, Macedonian
- [LANG](lang/) - discrimination between closely related languages (Bosnian, Croatian, Montenegrin, Serbian)

TODO:
* Add Sent predictions
* Add pretraining info for the Sent predictions (they can be included in the predictions json, but it should be linked and explained in the readme)
* Update the table with the results for the run, corresponding to the predictions
* Update the table in SENT tresults with the links to the models published
