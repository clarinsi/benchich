# BENCHić-lang - the language discrimination part of the BENCHić benchmark

The task in this part of the benchmark is to be able to discriminate between the four languages this benchmark covers - Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian and Montenegrin.

The benchmark consists of two datasets - a newspaper-based one covering Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian, and another Twitter-based one, covering all four languages.
